              <h4 class="text-center">ECSESS RoboElectronics is an organization aiming to teach McGill ECSE students basic hands on electrical and electronics skills. Through weekly workshops, they teach you everything you need to know in order to build and program your own autonomous robot. Whatâ€™s more, an end of semester competition will tie everything in and allow you to measure your skills against your fellow classmates. By joining ECSESS RoboElectronics, you will gain: problem solving skills, the ability to work in teams in order to accomplish a complex task and, last but not least, technical knowledge not taught in class.</h4>
